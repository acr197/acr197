# Nice to meet you 👋

I use AI and automation to modernize outdated workflows in data, marketing, and operations.  
Not a developer by title—but I speak the language, understand the pain points, and move fast.

If it’s too small for engineering but too annoying to ignore, I’ll automate it with AI tools. It’s how I keep teams moving fast without burning budget.

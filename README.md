# Nice to meet you 👋

This GitHub showcases how I use automation and data enablement to improve marketing technology workflows and make BI teams’ lives easier.

- I work at the intersection of **data enablement, marketing operations, media technology, and workflow automation**.  
- My background is in ad operations and data, and now I wrangle governance, dashboards, and automation — the boring-but-critical stuff that keeps BI teams productive. My unofficial KPI? How many analysts made it through reporting week without rage-slamming their laptops shut.
- Not a developer by trade, but I wield SQL, VBA, and Python to turn “repeat this 100 times” into “done in one script.”

## ⚙️ What You’ll Find Here
- **Capstone Project (Modal.io)**: Automating a weekly cross-client reporting process with prompt engineering
- **Work Automation**: VBA + API mashups to replace tedious manual reporting  
- **Home Projects**: Smart-home automations and browser scripts (because if it’s repetitive, I’ll automate it)

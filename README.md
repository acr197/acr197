# Nice to meet you 👋

This GitHub is where I share and brag about turning  messy marketing workflows and non-work everyday redious tasks into clean, automated systems that make everybody's lives easier.

* I work at the intersection of **data enablement, marketing ops, media tech, and workflow automation**.
* I started in ad ops and data, now I tame dashboards, governance, and reporting so analysts survive reporting week.
* Not a developer by trade, but I make SQL, VBA, and Python do the heavy lifting.

# Nice to meet you 👋

This GitHub is where I share and brag about using AI to turn messy marketing workflows and tasks into clean, automated products and automations that make everybody's lives easier.

* My past and current work intersects **data governance, marketing operations, media technology, workflow automation, fintech, and product conceptualization to creation**.
